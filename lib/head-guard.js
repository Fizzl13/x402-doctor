// head-guard.js
//
// Express answers HEAD with the GET route, and the x402 middleware only guards
// the methods in its route keys ("GET /signal/:pair"): a HEAD request slipped
// past the paywall and ran the paid handler for free (no body went back, but
// the work was done, e.g. a 5-second /fix). Here a HEAD on a paid path is
// handled as the GET it stands for, so it gets the normal 402 (Node sends no
// body for HEAD). A HEAD that carries a payment is refused: it would pay and
// get nothing back.
