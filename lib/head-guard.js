// head-guard.js
//
// Express answers HEAD with the GET route, and the x402 middleware only guards
// the methods in its route keys ("GET /signal/:pair"): a HEAD request slipped
// past the paywall and ran the paid handler for free (no body went back, but
// the work was done, e.g. a 5-second /fix). Every HEAD is now handled as the
// GET it stands for: paid paths get the normal 402 (Node sends no body for
// HEAD), free paths answer as before. Not only exact paths: Express also
// matches /SCAN and /scan/. A HEAD that carries a payment is refused: it would
// pay and get nothing back.
